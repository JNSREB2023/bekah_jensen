The analysis studies 1,000 colleges with information on student size, tuition prices, diversity, region, and graduation rates. Studying this information could be useful in determining what factors help students graduate. Those inquiring about a future college career could use the information when deciding where to attend school.\nEducation is crucial for societal purposes. Education allows people to become evolved thinkers, be active participants in society, and the economy. Learning what factors help students graduate could help increase overall graduation rates. While this analysis does give some insight on what influences graduation rates, this information should not be used and cited as this is not an official analysis.",

Again we really can’t pull reliable inferences from this since the sample sizes are skewed, especially since New York, which has some of the most prestigious universities in the country, has the lowest graduation rate and only one singular occurrence in the dataset.\nWe can run a regression model on the following variables and see if any are statistically significant.\n\n\n\nTerm\nCoefficient\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n0.28883021499055983\n\n\nStudent_Size\n2.19323220e-06\n\n\nTuition_In_State\n-2.38317495e-06\n\n\nTuition_Out_State\n1.14899535e-05\n\n\nRegion_numeric\n-3.72713468e-02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nMean Squared Error\n0.020479592983903977\n\n\nR-squared\n0.2711396143816296\n\n\n\nWe cannot pull inference from this model, however it is interesting to see if there is an interaction between certain variables.\n\n\nPlots\n\n\nCode\nsns.scatterplot(data=data, x=\"Tuition_In_State\", y=\"Grad_Rate\", hue=\"Region\")\nplt.xlabel('Tuition In State')\nplt.ylabel('Graduation Rate')\nplt.title('In State Tuition Vs.
